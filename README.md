# 🌈 Logan.fun — Learning React the Fun Way

Welcome to **Logan.fun**, a personal playground of small web experiments and interactive "toys" built by **Logan Whitcomb**.  
This project exists as a way for me to **test and improve my skills** as I learn **React** and **React Native**, while keeping the process creative and fun.

## 🧠 About the Project

Inspired by [neal.fun](https://neal.fun), this site is a growing collection of bite-sized projects that explore ideas through code —  
sometimes useful, sometimes weird, but always made to learn something new.

> ✨ “Small ideas, built beautifully — and used to get better at coding.”

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Setup)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CustomDevv/logan.fun.git
cd logan.fun
npm install
npm run dev
```
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.


Each folder inside /app is its own self-contained experiment.

🧭 Navigation
Every toy includes a “← Back home” link at the top to return to the main gallery.
Just add a new folder in /app for your next experiment.

💡 Goal
This repo isn’t about perfection — it’s about progress.
I’m using it to:

Practice React Native concepts in small web projects

Learn component design and state management

Build confidence deploying full-stack apps

Keep experimenting and having fun with code
