### ✨ Tiny, playful web experiments — built just for fun.

A personal collection of interactive mini-projects exploring creative coding, data visualization, and little curiosities of the web.  
Everything here is lightweight, open source, and built to make you smile. 😄

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “The web should be fun.”  

logan.fun is a creative sandbox — a space for experiments that don’t need to be *useful* to exist.  
No ads, no tracking — just code and curiosity.
